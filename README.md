# Graduate Salary Analysis with Z-Test and T-Test

This repository contains an analysis of graduate salary data, using both Z-score and one-sample T-test methodologies to assess whether the sample mean significantly differs from a given population mean. The purpose is to evaluate statistical evidence on graduate salary trends and make inferences based on these statistical tests.

## Project Overview
The project includes:
- **Dataset**: Graduate salary data (in thousands).
- **Analysis Techniques**: 
  - **Z-Test**: Calculation of Z-score and P-value to test the sample mean against the hypothetical population mean.
  - **One-Sample T-Test**: Used for hypothesis testing to determine if the sample data significantly differs from the population mean.
- **Hypotheses**:
  - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The mean salary of graduates is equal to the population mean.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The mean salary of graduates is significantly different from the population mean.

## Files
- **z_test_analysis.R**: Script for Z-score calculation with statistical comparison against a population mean.
- **t_test_analysis.R**: Script for one-sample T-test analysis on graduate
